        "description": "In this lesson, we'll dive into the fascinating world of money! Money comes in different forms, like coins and bills. Imagine coins as little metal circles and bills as paper rectangles. These are what we use to buy things. But did you know that in the past, people used to trade things instead of using money? It's called bartering. For example, if you had apples and wanted oranges, you'd trade with someone who had oranges and wanted apples."
